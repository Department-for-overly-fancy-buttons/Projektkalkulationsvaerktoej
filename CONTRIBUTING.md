# Contributing Guidelines
*We encourage pull requests, bug reports and all other kind of contributions to this project! The three awesome members of the Department Of Overly Fancy Buttons will review them one by one, where we after will be neccessary to deny them as this is an exam project where contributors are not actually allowed. But contribute anyways! It'll be a great meaningless excersize!*

> **These guidelines are ment to set the expectations we have for all contributors to this project. The guide is made to ensure that we all help eachother in the best way possible, not neglecting nor insulting anyones contributions. We do also expect that no contributors outside of The Department of Overly Fancy Buttons will feel insulted when their requests will be declined due to exam-rule-restrictions. We still appriciate the effort!**

## Asking Questions
Asking questions should be done through filing bugs or featuring requests. If it's urgent, feel free to write a mail to DepartmentOfOverlyFancyButtons@DiffenatelyNotAfakeMail.com, which we can guarantee with a 20% certainty is not a fake mail. 

## Opening an Issue
Make sure you have the latest version of the project before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue). In many cases, this will fix the issue. If not, follow Githubs guide linked here to open the issue.

## Bug Reports and Other Issues
To contribute the best way possible, please follow these steps to make the best possible bug-report! We truely appriciate the bug-report being written as clearly as possible, as it will help us fix the issue faster.
#### Steps:
- **Make sure you do not open a duplicate issue**. Check if the issue already exists
- **Do not comment on existing issues**, if you just want to +1 it. **Instead, do [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**
- **Be clear with the bug.** Be concise and descriptive. Provide all the information you possibly can, and if possible, include the steps to reproduce the bug. It will help a lot to fix the issue.

## Submitting Pull Requests
Before [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests), it is adviced to open an issue og check for existing issues, so we know if it is actually a needed thing you are fixing. Let's save you some time before we decline your awesome pull request.

- **When you do submit a pull request, make sure it is focused on one issue and not more than one.** We prefer the submits being isolated issues being fixed to avoid complications and confusion. It is better that we have many small issues rather than small fixes nonrelated to the actual issue being fixed in a pull request.
  
- **For larger changes make sure to coordinate with the Depratment of Overly Fancy Buttons,** so that a strategy can be put to work regarding the specific issues.
  
- **Code must be written clearly and concisely,** so that the documentation is easily understandable by future programmers and our team.
  
- **Follow the existing codeing-style we have for a cleaner and readable look.**

- **Include tests.** Make sure there is both Unit Tests and UI tests when possible. Follow existing Arrange, Act & Assert patterns for the tests.

- **Use the default branch** from the repo and [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to that branch. This will be 'main' in our project.

- **[Resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)** that may happen.

- **Remember to address any CI failures**. If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, you must push another commit to fix it. It must pass the tests before merged with our default / main branch.

- When writing comments, try to use proper sentences with punctuation. Avoid slang and use spaces instead of tabs.

## Writing Commit Messages
First write the commit messages title
Write the commit headings in capital letters ending with colon. 
Then write the fixes or additions in an unordered list form. 
If there is severeal fixes, mark it in the commit message by making a new heading in capital letters ending with colon. 
Put parantheses around the classes the is changed/ deleted etc.

**Example:**
*(Commit title)*
ADDED:
- Create account (controller, service) 
- Delete account (controller)
- Edit account (service)
FIXED:
- Bug with 'create project' endpoint (controller)

## Code Review
**Review the code, not the author** - If you suggest improvements or changes to existing code, remember to provide actionable feedback and explain the reasoning behind the changes. We are all working together as a team and **we are not our code**. We should help eachother improve in an including and positive way. Also, the fact that you WILL be denied by your contributions does not mean we do not appriciate your effort. We simply are not allowed to. For some reason, we still insist on you trying to contribute right. 
**Do your best**: we all do the best we can to write the best possible code to help on the project. Let's continue to do our best; no one makes mistakes on purpose.

## Final Words
If you have read this far: **Thank you!!** To prove you have read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue, please write 'FancyButtonsRock' in your message. That way we know you are taking our guidelines seriously. We truely appriciate your time!
