# Contributing Guidelines
*We encourage pull requests, bug reports and all other kind of contributions to this project! The three awesome members of the Department Of Overly Fancy Buttons will review them one by one, where we after will be neccessary to deny them as this is an exam project where contributors are not actually allowed. But contribute anyways! It'll be a great meaningless excersize!*
